This repo contains the slides for my talk at [Data Makers Fest 2024](https://www.datamakersfest.com/)

### Title
Integrating AI into traditional industries: a strategic blueprint

### Abstract
This talk delves into the strategic integration of artificial intelligence into the operation of traditional industries, in particular on the challenges faced when doing so. A set of practices is suggested to address the experimental nature of AI development and reduce our exposure to its risks. There will be concrete examples of experience made under different industries and use cases, such as forecasting, computer vision and, more recently, Generative AI."
